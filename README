Lab Name: Weekly-lab1
Instructions on how to compile:

terminal: Compile by typing "gcc lab1.c"
a.out will be created, and the program can be run.
You will need to give an input file and output file upon request and the rest is done according to instruction.

What seems to be peculiar is that the copying speed is incredibly fast. I'm confident that the parameters are correct but it seems unusual that a 30000 line file would take around 0.080 seconds. Maybe my thinking is incorrect? 
My parameters may be incorrect as well, but to my understanding I think they are correct. 
I read byte by byte and write whatever is in the buffer using a while loop, which I think works out to be fine according to instructions.
